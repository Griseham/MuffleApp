          "body": "Funny story. \n\n20 years ago I had a friend who fought lightweight MMA in Canada. Hated Geddy Lee‚Äôs voice. Drove him nuts. \n\nNow, the worst part of being a MMA fighter is cutting weight the day before. Just drains the moral of the fighter. You‚Äôre sitting in a sauna in a track suit dehydrating yourself 24 hours before getting punched in the face for a couple hundred bucks. Stupid life choices, but hey, to each their own. \n\nNobody wants to help a guy cut weight. It‚Äôs just a miserable experience. You‚Äôre hanging out, keeping the guy company, sneaking off to drink water and making sure the guy doesn‚Äôt accidentally mess himself up. Meanwhile, a professional fighter is getting quite irritable, and you‚Äôre the focus of his frustration. \n\nNow, this particular weight cut, my friend is getting on my last nerve. I know he‚Äôs dehydrated and angry, but the idle threats on my life are getting a little too detailed. I got to take it, because this isn‚Äôt about me, it‚Äôs about him, but all his rhetoric is getting filed in the old mental Rolodex. \n\nWe get to weigh ins and he makes weight. Promoter takes me aside (I‚Äôm his second in the corner, promoter is smart enough not to start a conversation with a dehydrated fighter), and asks about walk out music so he can get licensing. \n\nWe agreed it would be Hatebreed, his favourite band at the time. \n\nWell, guess what? Fuck him. \n\n‚ÄúTom Sawyer by Rush‚Äù. I say. \n\nFight night comes, we‚Äôre at the entrance, opponent is in ring. He gets to the gorilla spot and the music hits. \n\nHe turns and looks right through me. Like a hundred yard stare into my soul. \nI‚Äôm still choked at him, so I‚Äôm beaming from ear to ear, like the asshole I am. He knows. I know he knows. He knows I did it on purpose, no fucks given. The lead corner can feel the heat; you could fry an egg on my fat bald head. \n\nWe get walking and he‚Äôs stiff. Madder than shit. I‚Äôm loving this moment. \n\nFight starts, they dance for a minute, no take downs, get into a clinch, go for a break, and my guy throws an elbow, catches his opponent on the button. \n\nFirst round knock out, from an elbow. \n\nNobody gets knocked out by an elbow. It‚Äôs one of those ‚Äústars aligned‚Äù, buy a lottery ticket, struck by lightning moments. \n\nCrowd goes nuts, interview goes great, promoters gushing over him, opponents corner (great guys, great gym) can‚Äôt believe what happened. \n\nWe get to the back, his gloves get cut and bagged, hit the showers, and he turns to me;\n\n‚ÄúWhy would you do that?‚Äù \n\nI look him dead in the eye, and tell him the truth;\n\n‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Tom Sawyer he gets high on you, and the space he invades, he gets by on you!‚Äù\n\nWhen I came to, the promoter and rep from the commission are standing over me. My guys in the shower with his lead corner, cooling off. Commish rep asks if he should write a report, I told him I had it coming and it‚Äôs best if we keep it dark. They agree; nobody wants the bad press. \n\nFor years after, every time Tom Sawyer came on the radio, I‚Äôd crank it up and call him to make sure he‚Äôd hear it. Even played it for him at my wedding (he was a groomsman). \n\nThe gym took me off weight cut duty the next week. \n\nGood times. I wish I could live that moment again. \n\nI hope Geddy Lee lives forever.",
