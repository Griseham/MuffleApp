# Muffle Threads Project Documentation

## Project Overview

Muffle Threads is a React application that visualizes music and content in an interactive starfield interface. The application allows users to explore music genres, artists, and posts in a spatial environment with various visual elements like constellations, genre wheels, and interactive particles. It combines social media aspects with music discovery in a visually immersive experience.

## Key Components and Architecture

### Front-end Architecture

The application is structured using a feature-based directory organization:

- `/src/components/` - Core UI and visualization components
- `/src/pages/` - Feature-specific pages organized by functionality:
  - `/comments/` - Comment-related components and utilities
  - `/modals/` - Modal overlay components  
  - `/posts/` - Post display and interaction components
  - `/threads/` - Thread and conversation components
  - `/user/` - User profiles and user-related features
  - `/utils/` - Shared utilities and helper functions
  - `/visualizations/` - Data visualization components

- `/src/styles/` - CSS stylesheets
- `/src/backend/` - Server-side logic and data handling

### Core Components

1. **StarfieldWithUsers.jsx**
   - The main visualization component
   - Renders a navigable starfield with stars, user positions, and genre information
   - Handles interactions like zooming, navigation, and selection
   - Uses quadrant-based distribution for more balanced visual elements
   - Fixed positioning for the genre wheel to ensure it stays centered during scrolling

2. **ModernGenreWheel.jsx** and **EnhancedGenreWheel.jsx**
   - Display a wheel of music genres that changes based on position in the starfield
   - Show the current blend of genres in the user's feed
   - Uses animated transitions for smooth genre changes

3. **ConstellationOverlay.jsx**
   - Renders artist constellations in the starfield
   - Creates astronomical-style patterns for artists with interactive nodes

4. **EnhancedArtistFilterBar.jsx**
   - Search and filter interface for artists
   - Connects to backend APIs for artist data
   - Manages artist selection and constellation navigation

5. **ThreadDetail.jsx** and **GroupChatDetail.jsx**
   - Display detailed post and conversation information
   - ThreadDetail shows comments, ratings, and multimedia content
   - GroupChatDetail renders conversation-style interfaces with avatars

6. **Home.jsx**
   - Main container component that orchestrates the application
   - Manages feed loading and coordinates between starfield and content display
   - Handles filtering and displaying posts based on user preferences and position
   - Provides responsive layout that scales the feed content

### Utility Files

1. **starfieldUtils.js**
   - Core utilities for starfield generation and rendering
   - Includes functions for star generation, user positioning, and coordinate calculations
   - Contains mathematical utilities like polar-to-cartesian conversion and arc path generation
   - Implements quadrant-based star distribution for balanced visual representation

2. **genreUtils.js**
   - Music genre data and processing utilities
   - Functions for generating genre sets, colors, and transitions

### Backend Structure

The backend is built with Node.js and provides several key API endpoints:

1. **server.js**
   - Main server file handling API requests
   - Implements caching mechanisms for posts and data
   - Provides endpoints for post fetching, comments, and music-related data

2. **Caching System**
   - Implements intelligent caching with configurable TTL (Time To Live)
   - Stores post data to allow quick retrieval and reduce API calls
   - Manages a diverse set of cached posts to ensure variety

3. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/posts` - Fetches and returns posts from various sources
   - `/api/cached-posts` - Retrieves posts from the cache system
   - `/api/diverse-posts` - Provides posts with maximum diversity
   - `/api/posts/:id/comments` - Fetches comments for specific posts
   - `/api/apple-music-search` - Interfaces with music APIs for song search

## Data Flow

1. The application starts with a starfield centered on the user's position
2. As the user navigates, genre information changes based on position
3. The server fetches and caches posts from multiple subreddits, filtering for quality
4. Artists can be searched and added as constellations in the starfield
5. Posts are represented as stars with associated content
6. Users can select stars/nodes to view detailed information
7. Genre wheels and artist filters provide additional navigation options
8. The backend server manages data persistence and retrieval, with caching for performance

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Starfield Navigation**
   - Smooth scrolling with star and dust particle animations
   - Friends and user positions represented by avatars
   - Boundary circles and labels define user territories
   - Quadrant-based distribution ensures balanced visual representation
   - Centered genre wheel that remains fixed during scrolling

2. **Genre Visualization**
   - Dynamic genre wheel that transitions as users navigate
   - Genres represented by colored arcs with proportional sizing

3. **Artist Constellations**
   - Unique constellations generated for each artist
   - Interactive nodes that display artist information
   - Navigation between multiple constellations per artist

4. **Content Discovery**
   - Posts displayed as stars in the starfield
   - Thread details with comments, ratings, and multimedia
   - Music snippets with playback controls
   - TikTok-style browsing mode for snippet content

5. **Social Interaction**
   - Comment composition with music snippet attachments
   - GroupChat interfaces for conversational interactions
   - User profiles with activity metrics and relationships
