  "selftext": "It doesn't have to be about making a deal with him, just meeting him in some capacity; a casual conversation, meeting him in hell, being hunted by or avoiding him, etc. \nI have all of Robert Johnsons songs on CD so I already have those, I'm a fan of \"The Devil Wears A Suit And Tie by Colter Wall\" and another good one is \"Devils Price by Poor Man's Poison.\" Oh and \"Devils Train by The Lab Rats.\"\nIt's not for any particularly reason, I just enjoy the symbolism and imagery these songs tend conjur but I'm having trouble finding songs that aren't just 80s and 90s black metal which I'm not a huge fan of.
