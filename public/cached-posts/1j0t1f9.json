  "author": "LowryIsSickass",
  "selftext": "For context, I am making a list of all of my favourite songs from each year between 1960 and 2025, and 1988 is the only year for which I can't seem to find a song that I truly love. The frontrunner for 1988 at the moment is Orange Crush by R.E.M. but that song is just OK in my opinion. If you can find me a song that is more enjoyable than Orange Crush by R.E.M. I will award you 1,000 points üòÆ\n\nUPDATE: Better Be Home Soon by Crowded House, Into Temptation by Crowded House and Culpable o no by Luis Miguel are among my new favourites from 1988.\n\nI appreciate all of your suggestions! Don't be afraid to suggest instrumental (classical/jazz) or non-English songs too. ",

Rage ended up the American voice in the genre not too long after, and they are indeed their own thing, but Vernon is just a special human in his musicianship that drove that bus like nobody's business.
